This was a group project for Software Engineering 1 - COMP 3350 of Winter 2024 using university GitLab accounts rather than personal ones. Credit belongs to me as it does to my fellow group members (Lingyu Meng, Apoorva Upadhyaya and Uday Shekhawat). The software was created using an agile development process and adheres to SOLID principles. Our goal was to satisfy user requests while ensuring minimal cohesion and better miantainability as in each iteration the project grew largly. It was also important for us to ensure extensive unit, integration and system testing of the software in every iteration.
